            <div class="col-lg-6  col-sm-12">
                <p>Naruto[a] is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masashi Kishimoto. It tells the story of Naruto Uzumaki, a young ninja who seeks recognition from his peers and dreams of becoming the Hokage, the leader of his village. The story is told in two parts – the first set in Naruto's pre-teen years, and the second in his teens. The series is based on two one-shot manga by Kishimoto: Karakuri (1995), which earned Kishimoto an honorable mention in Shueisha's monthly Hop Step Award the following year, and Naruto (1997).

                    Naruto was serialized in Shueisha's magazine, Weekly Shōnen Jump from 1999 to 2014, and released in tankōbon (book) form in 72 volumes. The manga was adapted into an anime television series produced by Pierrot and Aniplex, which broadcast 220 episodes in Japan from 2002 to 2007; the English dub of the series aired on Cartoon Network and YTV from 2005 to 2009. Naruto: Shippuden, a sequel to the original series, premiered in Japan in 2007, and ended in 2017, after 500 episodes. The English dub was broadcast on Disney XD from 2009 to 2011, airing the first 98 episodes, and then switched over to Adult Swim's Toonami programming block in January 2014, starting over from the first episode. The English dub is still airing weekly on Adult Swim to this day. Viz Media began streaming the anime series on their streaming service Neon Alley in December 2012 on 99 episodes, and ended in March 2016, after 338 episodes. Besides the anime series, Pierrot has developed eleven movies and twelve original video animations (OVAs). Other Naruto-related merchandise includes light novels, video games, and trading cards developed by several companies.
                    
                    Viz Media licensed the manga and anime for North American production and serialized Naruto in their digital Weekly Shonen Jump magazine. The anime series began airing in the United States and Canada in 2005, and in the United Kingdom and Australia in 2006 and 2007, respectively. The films and most OVAs from the series were also released by Viz, with the first film premiering in movie theaters. The story of Naruto continues with Naruto's son, Boruto Uzumaki, in Boruto: Naruto Next Generations: Boruto wishes to create his own ninja way instead of following his father's.
                    
                    Naruto is one of the best-selling manga series in history having 250 million copies in circulation worldwide in 47 countries and regions, with 153 million copies in Japan alone and remaining 97 million copies elsewhere. It has become one of Viz Media's best-selling manga series; their English translations of the volumes have appeared on USA Today and The New York Times bestseller list several times, and the seventh volume won a Quill Award in 2006. Reviewers praised the manga's character development, strong storylines, and well-executed fight scenes, though some felt the fight scenes slowed the story down. Critics noted that the manga, which has a coming-of-age theme, makes use of cultural references from Japanese mythology and Confucianism.

    <h1>NAKURO UZUMAKI</h1> 
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-6 col-sm-12">
            <p>Naruko was born to an unspecified Uzumaki mother and Namikaze father. In her infancy, her parents had died due to unknown causes, or at least that is what she had been told by the caretaker of the orphanage she has lived in for most of her life. All that is known about her parents is that her father was a Jōnin and her mother a Chūnin of Konohagakure.

                Ninja Academy
                Upon reaching the age of eight, Naruko had applied herself to become a conscript of the shinobi forces of her village. Being of Uzumaki descent had naturally helped her in the applications of Ninjutsu and Taijutsu. During her time in the academy, she had grown interested in the usage of the Clone Technique. Research and training was made into it, which eventually lead to a revelation of her having a knack in performing it easily. But due to it's disadvantage of being a very basic illusion, her curiosity would make her delve more advanced applications of it. One of which being a derived technique used for mischief. But even this would help her, in the usage of it to convince a female academy teacher to let her briefly overview a scroll for the Shadow Clone Technique. Upon her first few attempts, Naruko became quite proficient in it's usage.
                
                Due to learning such a complex technique for an academy student, an acknowledgement of her abilities were made, and Naruko was given the her village's forehead protector and the rank of Genin. This recognition of her abilities even had one of her academy teachers recommend to take up a chance of achieving the rank of Chūnin at one of the upcoming Chūnin Exams. Beaming from the amount of praise she has received, Naruko seems to have given herself the title of Konoha's Orange Prodigy (木ノ葉のオレンジ天才, Konoha no Orenji Tensai).
                
                Genin Era
                Arrangements were eventually made for her to move into her own home within the village once she had acquired enough funds after doing various small odd jobs. With the Chūnin Exams coming up in the next few months, self-training would begin for her, which would include research into a technique that exceeds the complexity of the Shadow Clone Technique.

    <h1>KUSHINA UZUMAKI</h1>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-6 col-sm-12">
            <p>Born into the famed Uzumaki clan of Uzushiogakure, Kushina lived most of her youth being caught up in war, making her seek for a daily peace. At a young age she was sent to Konoha and enrolled in the Academy.Wanting to make a strong first impression, she proclaimed to her class that she would be the first female Hokage. The other kids laughed at her statement, and began calling her "Tomato" (トマト) because of her then-round face and fiery red hair. This prompted her to lash out and pummel the kids who teased her. This, in addition to her red hair flying wildly around her as she did so, earned her the nickname of Red Hot-Blooded Habanero (赤い血潮のハバネロ, "Akai Chishio no Habanero", Viz: Red-Hot Habanero).Kushina was eventually told why she had to leave her home of Uzushio and go to Konoha; because of her special chakra, she was to be the next jinchūriki of the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox.[6] Kushina was terrified by the idea, but she was comforted by the Nine-Tails' then-current jinchūriki, Mito Uzumaki. Before the transfer was performed, Mito advised Kushina that love was the only way to tame the Nine-Tails and overcome its hate.When she was around 12 years old,[2] Kushina — now a genin — was kidnapped by Kumogakure who wanted to make use of her special chakra in order to gain control of the Nine-Tails.[8] As they escorted her to Kumo, she secretly plucked and left behind strands of her red hair to mark her trail in the hopes that someone would find her. Minato Namikaze, one of her former classmates that Kushina believed to be a wimp, was the only one to pick up on this. After rescuing her, he informed her that he had always admired her red hair. Since Minato proved himself to be anything but, accepted her, and liked the one thing she hated about herself, Kushina fell in love with him, now considering her red hair as the "red thread of fate" (運命の赤い糸, unmei no akai ito) that had brought them together.[9] Ultimately, Minato's reciprocated feelings helped her with overcoming the Nine-Tails.[10]

                As she grew up, Kushina became renowned for her beauty and unique ninjutsu style,[11] including the fūinjutsu of her clan.[12] At some point, Kushina married Minato. She was later present to witness her husband's reign as Fourth Hokage, being very excited for him when first learning of it.[13] During her ten-month jinchūriki-influenced pregnancy, she was secretly kept guarded by Minato's top student Kakashi Hatake under Minato's order.[14] Midway through the pregnancy, the expecting parents decided to name their unborn child "Naruto" after the main character of Jiraiya's first book. When Jiraiya asked if they were sure about it, stating that it was a name he had just came up with whilst eating a bowl of ramen one day, Kushina said that it was a beautiful name. They even approved of Jiraiya to be Naruto's godfather.[15] Kushina also hoped that her son and her friend Mikoto Uchiha's youngest son Sasuke would become friends in the future.[16]Because the seal keeping the Nine-Tails within Kushina's body would be at its weakest during childbirth, special arrangements were made. Kushina would leave the village in secret and give birth in a remote location. Minato would help maintain the seal and Anbu would guard the area. Soon after Naruto was born, however, they were found by a masked man. The masked man killed all of the Anbu, Biwako, Taji, and took the newborn baby Naruto hostage, threatening to kill him as well. Minato was able to take Naruto back, but this gave the masked ninja the chance to escape with Kushina. Wishing to use the Nine-Tails to destroy Konoha, the masked man released it from Kushina's body. The vitality inherent to the Uzumaki clan allowed her to survive the extraction, though she was greatly weakened by the experience. The masked ninja tried to have the Nine-Tails finish Kushina off but she was saved by Minato and brought to Naruto, who she stayed with while Minato went to help in the village's defence.[17]

                To stop the Nine-Tails' attack, Minato was forced to bring it to Kushina and Naruto's location, and both of them to its. While still weakened, Kushina used her diminished chakra to restrain the Nine-Tails. Despite fearing the trauma would kill her in her current state, Kushina volunteered to have the Nine-Tails sealed back into her body so that it would die with her. Willing to sacrifice herself for Minato and Naruto; her thanks to them for giving her such a happy life. Minato suggested using the Dead Demon Consuming Seal on the Nine-Tails and sealing it into Naruto instead, choosing to believe in him as his father.[18]
                As this would also mean Minato's death, and consequently give Naruto a horrible and lonely life, Kushina naturally objected. Minato, while understanding her concerns, convinced her that it was for the best because he believes in Naruto, and that doing this would also allow Kushina to see Naruto when he was older. After Minato sealed the Yin half of the Nine-Tails' chakra inside himself, the demon shrunk significantly, losing the chains. Realising the Hokage's intentions, the weakened Nine-Tails tried to kill Naruto, but both Minato and Kushina used their bodies to shield him. As Minato performed the sealing, and already at the point of death, Kushina told Naruto how much she loved him and gave him her best advice for the future; her final act in this world was to fill her son with as much of her love as possible. Minato then sealed the rest of their remaining chakra into Naruto.[19] In the anime, before dying, the Third Hokage appeared. Kushina told Hiruzen the child's name and begged the elder to protect Naruto, dying shortly afterwards.[14]

    <h1>FUKA UZUMAKI</h1>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-6 col-sm-12">
            <p>Fūka (フウカ, Fūka) was a kunoichi from the group of grave robbers who had dug up four of the dead Twelve Guardian Ninja.Fūka was portrayed as a seductive vixen as a way to lure her prey in and kill them with an Execution by Kiss. She would further speed up the process by giving her targets a choice between a French or traditional kiss. Her most preferable victims were those with a natural affinity for wind chakra. She took great pride in her appearance and would become infuriated when any harm came to her physical being, especially her hair, the very casing of her soul. During her second fight against Naruto Uzumaki, she showcased a sadistic side when she delighted in Naruto's anguish. She has shown an intelligent side as seen when she thought that Sora and Naruto were connected somehow.

                Fūka was a fairly tall and light-complexioned woman sporting a slender frame and a shapely figure. She was noticeably beautiful, with blue-eyes and a beauty-mark under the left side of her lips. She had flowing maroon-coloured hair that reached her hips with bangs that parted slightly to the right of her forehead and framed the sides of her face. Like the rest of her team, she dressed in a qípáo-like garment. However, unlike her team-mates, who's attire was loose and full-bodied, her wardrobe was rather scantily-clad, revealing her shoulders and upper back while the rest was form fitting. Her attire was dark-pink colouring with a lining of purple, grey, and yellow, and a matching disconnected arm warmers that reached down to her light-purple spandex shorts. She wore a pair of black low-heeled boots that reached her calves.Her young and attractive form was seemingly nothing but a façade as her soul is housed within her hair; when void of an actual form, her hair becomes a floating mass and black faceless centre with two glowing yellow eyes. Also, when angered enough, her body's face took on a more ghoulish nature with pronounced canine teeth. Upon sustaining injury, the sudden loss of body-control would result in a fragile, dull and considerably aged visage; this implies that she is much older than she portrays herself.

                Fūka was a very powerful kunoichi, enough to attract Kazuma's attention as a subordinate. Alongside her allies, she easily broke through the outer defences of Konohagakure (albeit the main forces were tricked to being relocated elsewhere).

    <h1>YUGITO NII</h1>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-6 col-sm-12">
            <p>Yugito Nii (二位ユギト, Nii Yugito) was a jōnin from Kumogakure and the jinchūriki of the Two-Tails, Matatabi.

                Yugito was made the Two-Tails' jinchūriki at the age of two and, at the end of a detestable training programme that was imposed on her, she was able to control her transformation into her tailed beast at will.[1] At some point in the anime, Yugito agreed to give Nekobaa a paw print of the Two-Tails for the Paw Encyclopaedia.[3]

                Yugito gained confidence in herself through hard work, making her a courageous, proud and wise kunoichi. This was seen when she was able to trap two members of Akatsuki, along with herself, in a building, vowing that they'd never leave alive, going as far as setting off explosions.[4] Also, it was said that she was firm, decisive, and thoughtful of her team-mates.[1]

                Yugito had long, straight, blonde, hair bound with taut bandages, dark eyes and she wore red lipstick. She wore a short-sleeved black and purple blouse and black pants, both of which had a design similar to clouds on them, purple fingerless gloves and a chain of blue beads wound around her left hand. She also wore the standard Kumogakure forehead protector, sandals and a kunai holster, which was strapped to her right thigh. Yugito also wore bandages around her arms and legs as well as a red belt around her waist.

                Yugito was a highly-skilled and powerful kunoichi that even Killer B looked up to, despite her being younger than him.[5] She was a decent strategist, as she managed to lead two Akatsuki members into a trap which sealed the room, effectively cutting off any escape routes. After her reincarnation and serving as one of Tobi's Six Paths of Pain, Yugito was seen with both the Sharingan and Rinnegan. Combining the perceptual and predictive abilities of the former with the shared field of vision ability of the latter allowed Yugito to use her attacks in a more precise and coordinated fashion as well as react to enemy attacks more efficiently, both individually and in conjunction and with the other jinchūriki.

    <h1>ERONINJA</h1>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-6 col-sm-12">
            <p>Naruto is given a scroll containing the secrets of making women fall for him, a scroll he uses at first on the women around him but soon on the shinobi world as a whole, giving birth to the Ero-ninjaEroninja is set on an Alternate Continuity from Naruto`s canon universe, and it features many changes from both manga and anime. It begins at the original second phase—Naruto Shippuden. The story so far has 97 chapters, and 3 companions stories: Eroninja: The Limelight, Eroninja: Little Black Book and Eroninja: Antithesis, all featuring different aspects and characters from Eroninja. Ficwad has been it´s home since 2013 and the story has been running since 2010. Some of the changes are:

                Events:  some events never take place, for example: Naruto never goes to Tenchi Bridge, instead he stays in Konoha, to practice with the scroll. At the same time some events are exclusive to Eroninja.
                Characters: a few characters are never introduced, while others secondary characters are more prominent like Yugito and Temari. Also, characters like Naruto and Ino have more mature personalities with different, clearer, goals, others grow to be stronger, Ino being a prime example of that.
                Temptation Touch and The Binding: two jutsu that Naruto learned from the mysterious scroll. The former let's Naruto affect women's feelings and libido; the latter allowing him to exert different levels of control over them, and effectively bind them to him. Both are major plot elements, and catalist to many of the changes in the story, specially during the first chapters. Later, Naruto starts to rely less and less on these skills. One major side effect of The Binding is to change the affected person Chakra color, to reflect her feelings in regard to the user.
                The Family: the given name to the members of the collective relationship formed by Naruto and many different women, a harem.
                The Fox Mark: a symbol created to represent the family, their ties and mark them. It resembles a 9 nine tail fox. The fox mark also represents the Women's Bath Association, a public cover for the women of the family.  The fox mark allows those who bear it, to be attuned to each other's emotions and feel their presence. It's also used as seal for the Hiraishin no Jutsu.
